## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

อ่านข้อมูลจาก txt
```{r}
data = read.table("input.txt")
print(data)
```

อ่านข้อมูลจาก csv
```{r}
data2 = read.csv("input2.csv")
print(data2)
```

Get the max salary from data frame
```{r}
sal = max(data2$salary)
print(sal)
```

Get person detail with max salary
```{r}
retVal <- subset(data2, salary == max(salary))
print(retVal)
```

All people working in IT Dept.
```{r}
retVal = subset(data2, dept == "IT")
print(retVal)
```

Get people in IT dept. whose salary is greater than 600
```{r}
info = subset(data2, dept == "IT" & salary > 600)
print(info)
```

Get people who joined on or after 2014
```{r}
retVal = subset(data2, as.Date(start_date) > as.Date("2014-1-1"))
print(retVal)
```

test with python
```{python}
def test():
  a = 5
  print(a)

test()
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
